# Barebones React Webapp

Barebones react app built from scratch. I'm hoping my commit history will be useful for those looking to learn about bootstrapping a React webapp.

Includes webpack/babel, tests (chai/mocha/enzyme), eslint (airbnb), webpack-dev-server, and a few other things already configured.

<h3>scripts</h3>
prefix with `yarn` or `npm run`

run: `yarn start`

test: `yarn test` or `yarn twatch` for test watcher

webpack-dev-server: `yarn server`

lint: `yarn lint`, fix with `yarn lint:fix`
